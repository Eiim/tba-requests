The source code and help document for TBA Requests.

## Note: TBA Requests is not currently available. You can still download and use the GAS file yourself, but you can't get it from Google's marketplace. The way Add-Ons are distributed has been changed and a lot more effort is required on my part to get it published. I'll try to get it up, but it's a low priority for me, so no guarantees.

TBA-Requests is a Google Sheets plug-in that is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pifloagheimbimgjjomlboekcpimjmom). It allows you to access data from The Blue Alliance's API v3 using Google Sheets' custom functions. For more information, see Help.txt or the [official Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gXv14J6kD4GPJuOErnbf-AW2xkxs6asXT-PaI-Gm1nM).
